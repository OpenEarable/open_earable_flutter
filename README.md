## Permissions
For your app to be able to use [UniversalBLE](https://pub.dev/packages/universal_ble) in this package, you need to grant the following permissions:
### Android

You need to add the following permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml file:

```xml
<!-- flutter_reactive_ble permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />

<!-- location permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION"/>
```

If you use location services in your app, remove `android:maxSdkVersion="30"` from the location permission tags

### iOS / macOS

For iOS it is required you add the following entries to the `Info.plist` file of your app. It is not allowed to access Core BLuetooth without this. See [our example app](https://github.com/PhilipsHue/flutter_reactive_ble/blob/master/example/ios/Runner/Info.plist) on how to implement this. For more indepth details: [Blog post on iOS bluetooth permissions](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/handling-ios-13-bluetooth-permissions-26c6a8cbb816)

iOS 13 and higher
* NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription

iOS 12 and lower
* NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription

For macOS, add the Bluetooth capability to the macOS app from Xcode.

## Getting Started
To get started with the OpenEarable Flutter package, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Add the package to your flutter project: \
  ```bash
  flutter pub add open_earable_flutter
  ```
  Alternatively, you can follow the instructions on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/open_earable_flutter/install)

2. **Import the package**:

  import 'package:open_earable_flutter/open_earable_flutter.dart';
  ```

3. **Initialize WearableManager**
  ```dart
  final WearableManager _wearableManager = WearableManager();
  ```

4. **Scan for devices**:
  ```dart
  _wearableManager.scanStream.listen((scannedDevice) {
    // Handle scanned devices
  });

  _wearableManager.startScan();
  ```

5. **Handle new connections**:
  ```dart
  // Deal with new connected devices
  _wearableManager.connectStream.listen((wearable) {
    // Handle new wearable connection
    
    wearable.addDisconnectListener(() {
      // Handle disconnection
    });
  });
  ```

6. **Connect to a device**:
  ```dart
  _wearableManager.connectToDevice(scannedDevice);
  ```
